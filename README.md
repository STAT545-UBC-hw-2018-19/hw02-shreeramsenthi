# Stat 545 Assignment 02

This repository holds my submission for the second homework assignment for the 2018 Fall iteration of the [STAT545](http://stat545.com) course at UBC. This assignment is meant as an introduction to the `tidyverse` group of packages, but in particular `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.

Please see dplyr_intro.md for the code, commentary, responses to questions, and plots.
